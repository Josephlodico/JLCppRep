# JLCppRep

A personal repository where I store projects and exercises as I learn C++.

## What's in here

This repo is a collection of my C++ work as I progress through learning the language — including small programs, exercises, and larger projects. It's mostly for my own reference and to track my progress over time.

## Structure

As the repo grows, projects and exercises will be organized into folders. Each folder should contain its own notes or comments explaining what it covers.

## Goals

- Get comfortable with core C++ concepts (pointers, memory management, OOP, etc.)
- Work through progressively more complex projects
- Keep a record of what I've built and learned along the way

## Notes

This is a learning repo, so code quality and approaches will vary as my understanding improves. Feel free to browse, but keep in mind things may be rough around the edges!
